## Quick Start

Set up a simple application using Node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple CRUD operations

## Installation

Use the node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install `mongodb`. Since `mongodb` is already in the `package.json` file then you can just run:

```bash
npm install
```

or in case it isn't there run:

```bash
npm install mongodb --save
```
